### Project Requirements:
&#9745; Your project must be implemented in Python.

&#9745; Your project must have a main function and at least three other functions, each of which must be accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.

&#9745; Your main function must be in a file called project.py, which should be in the “root” (i.e., top-level folder) of your project.

&#9745; Your 3 required custom functions other than main must also be in project.py and defined at the same indentation level as main (i.e., not nested under any classes or functions).

&#9745; Your test functions must be in a file called test_project.py, which should also be in the “root” of your project. Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with test_ (test_custom_function, for example, where custom_function is a function you’ve implemented in project.py).

&#9745; You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.

&#9745; Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.

&#9745; Any pip-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called requirements.txt in the root of your project.
